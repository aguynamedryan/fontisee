# Fontisee

I couldn't find a good (free) program that would let me view all of my local fonts easily.  So I wrote one.  I opted to use Electron because I knew how to easily display lots of different fonts using HTML and figure it'd be easier than learning how to do it in a native application.  I'm pretty sure I was right.
